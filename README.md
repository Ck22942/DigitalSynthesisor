# DigitalSynthesisor
In this project i have developed a Digital Synthesisor from scratch, without the use of MIDI. I have used ImGUI for the GUI, and Portaudio for the audio playback. 

Create and Save your own sounds by editing the spectral components of each sounds using additive synthesis, and adjusting the envelope of the Amplitude.

Test each of these sounds out on the digital piano tab.
